# Crypto Hustle Lite
In this project, I will develop an app that displays information about cryptocurrencies, such as their value, market cap, and percent change in value, which I will access using API calls. I will also implement a search bar that allows users to search for a specific currency.

## Goals
- Create an API key
- Read API documentation to understand how to make requests, either in GitHub docs or using the examples on the organizationâ€™s website
- Use the `useEffect()` hook as a replacement for previous mount/unmount functions
- Fetch API data with async/await syntax
- Use props to send variable data to a component for use in a variety of use cases
- Use conditional rendering, either with if statements or ternary operators, to display information on the page only when necessary and return to a default state if not
- Additionally practice using CSS to format pages

## Required Features
- User can view a list of at least 30 cryptocurrencies, including the image, name, and price of the coin in US dollars
- User can search for a specific coin in the list of cryptocurrencies by symbol

## Bonus Features
- User can view a list of cryptocurrency scams on a separate pane in the page
