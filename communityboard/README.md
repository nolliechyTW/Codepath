# Community Board
In this project, I will create an resources board for my community! On each card of my community board, I will display some information about the museums or tourist attractions in Philly.

## Goals
- Initialize a new React application with Vite
- Create a functional React component
- Define and pass props to components
- Apply CSS styling to React components

## Required Features
- Create a unique theme for events or resources relevant to a specific community
- Display at least 10 unique resources or events in a responsive card format

## Bonus Feathers
- Add buttons or links to a related resource on each card component
- Make the site responsive for both desktop and mobile formats
