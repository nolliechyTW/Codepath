# Timetabled
In this project, I will build a grid-style calendar with one-hour events that plan out a single week. Timetables can be informative, humorous, or exploratory. For example:

- General: Plan a vacation for a friend, family member, or pet
- History: A week in the life of a historical figure, timeline of a coup
- Psychology: How to adapt to a polyphasic sleep cycle
- True crime: The week before a famous crime
- View an exemplar of what you'll be creating in this lab here!
