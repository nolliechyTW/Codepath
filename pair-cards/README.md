# Flashcards!
In this project, I will be creating a web app for flashcards! Users will be able to learn common French phrases by studying cards in a randomized order.

## Goals
- Create a new component
- Share a small piece of data from one component to the next
- Utilize `useState()` to create state variables to help control component behavior
- Use the `onClick()` event to call a method
- Create multiple div sections to keep track of different chunks of information
- Use those div sections as the basis for CSS styling

## Required Features
- [x] The title of the card set and some information about it, such as a short description and the total number of cards are displayed
- [x] A single card at a time is displayed, only showing one of the components of the information pair
- [x] Create a list of card pairs (an array of dictionaries where each dictionary contains the question and answer is perfectly fine)
- [x] Clicking on the card shows the corresponding component of the information pair
- [x] Clicking the next button displays a random new card

## Bonus Features
- [x] Cards have different visual styles such as color based on their category
  - Difficulty: Easy/ medium/ difficult
