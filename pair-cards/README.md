# Flashcards!Pt. 1
In this project, I will be creating a web app for flashcards! Users will be able to learn common French phrases by studying cards in a randomized order.

## Goals
- Create a new component
- Share a small piece of data from one component to the next
- Utilize `useState()` to create state variables to help control component behavior
- Use the `onClick()` event to call a method
- Create multiple div sections to keep track of different chunks of information
- Use those div sections as the basis for CSS styling

## Required Features
- [x] The title of the card set and some information about it, such as a short description and the total number of cards are displayed
- [x] A single card at a time is displayed, only showing one of the components of the information pair
- [x] Create a list of card pairs (an array of dictionaries where each dictionary contains the question and answer is perfectly fine)
- [x] Clicking on the card shows the corresponding component of the information pair
- [x] Clicking the next button displays a random new card

## Bonus Features
- [x] Cards have different visual styles such as color based on their category
  - Difficulty: Easy/ medium/ difficult

# Flashcards!Pt. 2

In this project, I will build features that allow users to enter an answer (with exact or fuzzy matching) and move backwards and forwards through the list of cards.

## Goals
- Use useState() to create more state variables of different types
- Use state to change the visual appearance of the web app
- Use state to check that changes to other state are valid
- Use the onClick() and onChange() events to call methods to adjust or reset state variables
- Create space for user input with the input tag
- Create more nested components in order to handle increasing complexity

## Required Features
- [x] User Input
- The user can enter their guess in a box before seeing the flipside of the card
- Clicking on a submit button shows visual feedback about whether the answer was correct or incorrect
- [x] Moving Multiple Ways in the Card List
- A back button displayed on the card can be used to return to the previous card in a set sequence
- A next button displayed on the card can be used to navigate to the next card in a set sequence

## Bonus Features
- [x] A user’s answer may be counted as correct even when it is slightly different from the target answer
- [x] A counter displays the user’s current and longest streak of correct responses
