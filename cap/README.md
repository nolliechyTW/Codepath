# Cap
In this project, I will use the ApiFlash API to take screenshots of a given website with a variety of parameters. First, I signed up for an ApiFlash account and explored the query builder that allows me to test out queries. Then, I tried making a single static API call from your site. Finally, I built an interface that allows you to get your own screenshots and insert them into the page.

## Goals
- Use `useState` hook to create a state variable and a function that is used to update the state
- Make a static API call using `async`/`await` and save the results to a state variable
- Be able to add and edit query parameters for API calls

## Required Features
- Allow the user to add at least three parameters to a query to the ApiFlash API
- Display the screenshot returned by the ApiFlash call on the page
- On a separate part of the page, display all the images the user has queried thus far

## Bonus Features
- Display whether or not your web app has hit the maximum number of queries allowed using another API call
