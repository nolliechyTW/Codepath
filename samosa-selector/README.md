# Samosa Selector
In this project, I will create a game called Samosa Selector that is based on an incremental game called Cookie Clicker. The goal of the game is to produce as many cookies by clicking on the Big Cookie as you can. However, in this version, instead of clicking a cookie, the user will be selecting a delicious samosa.

## Goals
- Use `useState` hook to create a state variable and a function that is used to update the state
- Register an `onClick` event to a button in a React project
- Define event-handling functions in a React project

## Required Features
The user can click on the large samosa to increase their samosa count by 1. There are three available upgrades -- Double Stuffed, Party Pack, and Full Feast -- that the user can purchase to increase the number of samosas per click.
- A large samosa that the user can click to harvest one samosa at a time
- A counter displaying the number of samosas the user currently has
- Three upgrades that increase the effectiveness of the userâ€™s cursor at certain point thresholds

## Bonus Features
When purchasing an upgrade, the user loses samosas from their total count. There is also an added "pulse" effect to the samosa that shrinks the large samosa when clicked and grows when hovered over.
- When purchasing an upgrade, the user loses samosas from their total count
- Decrease the scale of the large samosa when the user clicks the samosa to create a pulse effect
